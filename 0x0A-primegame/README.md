Prime Number Game Winner

This Python script provides a function isWinner that determines the winner of a game played between Maria and Ben. In each round, they take turns choosing prime numbers from a set of consecutive integers, and the player who cannot make a move loses the round. The function calculates the winner for each round and identifies the overall winner.

Example
For example, with x = 3 and nums = [7, 10, 15], the function calculates the winner for each round, and the overall winner might be "Maria" or "Ben" based on the number of rounds won.
