FEWEST OPERATIONS TO REACH n H CHARACTERS

This program calculates the fewest number of operations required to achieve exactly n H characters in a text file using two available operations: "Copy All" and "Paste".

PROBLEM DISCRIPTION

Given a number n, the program aims to determine the minimum number of operations required to produce exactly n H characters in a text file. The available operations are "Copy All," which copies all characters in the file, and "Paste," which pastes the previously copied characters. Initially, the file contains a single character 'H'.

SOLUTION APPROACH

The problem can be solved using a greedy approach.

1. Greedy Approach:

The greedy approach involves finding the prime factorization of n and returning the sum of its factors. This solution works because finding the prime factors corresponds to finding the smallest possible number of operations needed to achieve n H characters.

The implementation of the `minOperations` method using the greedy approach can be found in the code provided.

USAGE

The `minOperations` method can be used as follows:

result = minOperations(n)

Replace n with the desired number of H characters.
The method will return an integer representing the fewest number of operations needed to achieve n H characters. If n is impossible to achieve, the method will return 0.

Example

Here's an example usage of the minOperations method:

n = 18
result = minOperations(n)
print(f"The fewest number of operations required to achieve {n} H characters: {result}")

Conclusion
The program provides an efficient solution to calculate the fewest number of operations required to achieve a specific number of H characters in a text file. Whether using the greedy or dynamic programming approach, the minOperations method returns the desired result. Feel free to use the provided code or modify it as needed for your own applications.
