This Python script provides a function makeChange that helps you determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount total using a list of different coin values. The function uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the minimum number of coins required.

Function

def makeChange(coins, total):
    """
    Calculates the fewest number of coins needed to meet the given amount total.

    :param coins: List of coin values (list of integers).
    :param total: The target total amount (integer).
    :return: Fewest number of coins needed to meet the total, or -1 if not possible.
