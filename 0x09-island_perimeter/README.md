Island Perimeter Calculator

This Python script provides a function island_perimeter that calculates the perimeter of an island described in a grid. The function follows specific rules to determine the perimeter based on land and water cells.

NOTE

The function calculates the perimeter based on land and water cells, considering their positions and adjacent cells.

The grid should be rectangular, with its width and height not exceeding 100.

The grid is assumed to be completely surrounded by water.

There should be only one island (or none).

The island doesn’t have "lakes" (water inside that isn’t connected to the water surrounding the island).
