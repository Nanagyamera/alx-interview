UTF-8 Encoding Validation

This Python script provides a method to determine if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. The method can handle characters ranging from 1 to 4 bytes in length and checks for proper UTF-8 encoding rules.

METHOD

The validUTF8(data) method takes a list of integers as input, where each integer represents 1 byte of data. The method iterates through the list and checks if the data forms valid UTF-8 characters according to the UTF-8 encoding rules.

A UTF-8 character can have 1 to 4 bytes, and the method checks for the following byte patterns:

1-byte character: 0xxxxxxx

2-byte character: 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx

3-byte character: 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

4-byte character: 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

Any byte sequence that doesn't match these patterns is considered invalid UTF-8 encoding.

USAGE

To use the validUTF8(data) method, import it into your Python script. Pass the list of integers representing the data to be checked. The method will return True if the data is a valid UTF-8 encoding; otherwise, it will return False
